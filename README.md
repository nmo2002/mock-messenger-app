# mock-messenger-app
This is a cool messenger app designed by myself using Python, the Tkinter/Tkbootstrap library, socket programming techniques, algorithms/OOP, threading, and API development which I took solely upon myself. I also tried implementing a encryption system using OpenSSL and signed certificates (still trying to figure out how to implement).
